File 1 to 4 is an overview of CSS basic properties.
  From colors and font properties to the box model.
  The final project to wrap up this basic CSS review is a funny meme.
  
File 5 to 5.3 is an overview of different uses of CSS Selectors and CSS positioning.
  The final project helped wrapping up these different notions with the coding of the Flag of Laos.

File 6 to 6.3 concentrates on more advanced CSS notions such  as different types of displays, and how to create responsive websites through Media Queries.
  File 6.3 is the final project that applied different notions seen before in files 1 to 5.3 and 
  recapped the skills developped from file 6 to 6.3.
